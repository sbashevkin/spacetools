Description: This package provides a series of functions designed to make complicated spatial operations in R much easier. Applications are focused on aquatic distance related uses, with built in functionality for the Sacramento San Joaquin Delta. Users can calculate in-water distances between points, move points outside a shapefile to the closest location within the shapefile, and cluster points within a given radius. More functions will be added in the future.
